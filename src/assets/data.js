      "Zuma Rock, one of Nigeriaâ€™s iconic natural wonders, is a large monolith (a single stone or rock) located between Niger state and the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria, Abuja. The quickest way to see this grand monolith is by looking at the 100 naira note. It should inspire you enough to want to see the real thing.Historically, Zuma rock was a safe haven for the Gbagyi during the intertribal wars when they were encroached upon by neighbouring tribes. The Gwari people believe that the rock is a gateway to the afterlife.Zuma rock rises 725 metres (2,379 ft) above its surroundings. It is sometimes called the 'Gateway to Abuja from Suleja'. A vantage spot called the Zuma Rock Nigerian Village was constructed behind the rock to house tourists.",
